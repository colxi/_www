<h1 id="projectTitle">DUSTLAND : RETRO GAME EXPERIMENT</h1>
<div id="projectColumns">
    <div id="projectFirstColumn">
        <span class="accent">Dustland</span> is an experiment about <span class="code">retro arcade games development</span>. It's been developed using the fantastic <span class="accent"><a href="https://script-8.github.io" target="_blank">SCRIPT-8</a></span> platform, which provides the necessary playground for easy sprite creation and manipulation (among so many other things). The game provides some basic physic mechanics, and the necessaru input handling to let the user interact with the map and enemies.<br>  
        The SCRIPT-8 engine has been pushed out of its bound in this implementation, when using (non-nativelly supported) multi-sprite characters, complex sprites animations, and a (kinda hacky) double layered map, to achieve more expressive characters, and more immersive and captivating maps. Obviously always conditioned by the limitations of an 8-bit simulated environment.
        <br><br>
        To test the game, click in its viewport to set focus, and use the <span class="accent">ARROW KEYS</span> for movement, <span class="accent">A</span> for kick, and <span class="accent">SPACEBAR</span> to toggle Debug mode on/off.
        <br><br>
        <span class="bold">Note</span> : This game implementation is just an experiment, don't expect a complete game experience. All the game code is available in the <span class="accent">CODE TAB</span>, and the sprites and maps can be found in the <span class="accent">ART TAB</span>.
