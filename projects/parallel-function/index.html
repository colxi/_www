        This open source library lets you create a new thread (Web Worker) with a function, and keep it alive and ready to be called as many times as you need, <span class="accent">asynchronously</span> in the background, without blocking your main thread event loop.<br>
        With this simple solution you can move to secondary threads your heavy functions, and enjoy multithreading in a way that feels like calling a regular <span class="accent">async</span> function. <br>
